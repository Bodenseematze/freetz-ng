		UltraVNC Repeater has two unique functions:
		Mode 1:
		Allows for connection to multiple servers (in listen mode), using only
		one port. All connection data flows through the repeater, allowing
		connection to multiple servers through a single port forward or tunnel.
		Mode 2: 
		Allows both a Viewer and Server to connect together using the repeater
		as a PROXY. All connection data flows through the repeater, allowing
		both the server and viewer to be behind firewalls or routers.
