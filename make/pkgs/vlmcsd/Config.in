		vlmcsd is a fully Microsoft compatible KMS server hat provides
		product activation services to clients.
		It is designed to run on POSIX compatible operating systens.
		Only requirements are a basic C library with a BSD-style
		sockets API and either fork(2) or pthreads(7). That allows it
		to run on most embedded systems like routers, NASes, etc.
